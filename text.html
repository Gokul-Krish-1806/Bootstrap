            <h4 class="card-title">KTM</h4>
<p>In 1953, businessman Ernst Kronreif became a major shareholder of the company, which was renamed and registered as Kronreif & Trunkenpolz Mattighofen. In 1954, the R125 Tourist was introduced,[17] followed by the Grand Tourist[18] and the scooter Mirabell[19] in 1955.

    The company secured its first racing title in the 1954 Austrian 125cc national championship.[20] In 1956, KTM made its appearance at the International Six Days Trials, where Egon Dornauer won a gold medal on a KTM machine.[21]
    
    In 1957, KTM built its first sports motorcycle, the Trophy 125cc.[22] KTM's first moped, named Mecky, was launched in 1957, followed by Ponny I in 1960 and Ponny II in 1962 and Comet in 1963.[23] The 1960s also saw the beginning of bicycle production in Mattighofen.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">DUCATI</h4>
<p>In 1926 Antonio Cavalieri Ducati and his three sons, Adriano, Marcello, and Bruno, founded Società Scientifica Radiobrevetti Ducati (SSR Ducati) in Bologna to produce vacuum tubes, condensers and other radio components. In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city. Production was maintained during World War II, despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing. It was finally destroyed by around 40 Consolidated B-24 Liberators on 12 October 1944 as part of the United States Army Air Forces's Operation Pancake, which involved some 700 aircraft flying from airfields in the Province of Foggia.In 1950, after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold, in collaboration with SIATA, the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle.

        <h4 class="card-title">NINJA</h4>
<p class="caed-text">JThe street-legal Ninja H2 has mirrors in place of the track-only H2R's winglets,[21] and plastic body panels in place of the H2R's carbon-fiber panels. The street-legal H2 is said to make 200 horsepower (150 kW), probably with reduced supercharger boost compared to the H2R.[21] The H2 and H2R share the supercharger (with a lower boost level on the H2) and many other components, with the exception of the head gasket, cam profile and timing with ECU mapping, exhaust system, and clutch (the H2R's clutch has two additional plates).[1]Meanwhile, at the small Turinese firm SIATA (Società Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie), Aldo Farinelli began developing a small pushrod engine for mounting on bicycles. Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine
